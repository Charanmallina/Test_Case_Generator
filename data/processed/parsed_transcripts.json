      "transcript": "Agent: Total Wireless support, this is Frank. Customer: I keep getting \nSMS alerts saying I've used 90% of my data, but I'm on an unlimited plan. Why am I \ngetting data limit warnings? Agent: That's definitely confusing for an unlimi ted plan \ncustomer. Let me check your plan details and alert settings. Customer: I switched to \nunlimited specifically to avoid worrying about data limits, but these constant alerts are \nstressing me out. Agent: I can see you're on our unlimited plan, but the  SMS alert \nsystem is still configured for your previous limited data plan. Customer: So when I \nchanged plans, the alert system didn't update automatically? Agent: That's correct. Plan \nchanges should automatically update all associated alert settings, but t hat didn't happen \nin your case. Customer: I've been restricting my data usage for weeks thinking I was \nabout to hit a limit that doesn't even exist! Agent: I'm very sorry about that. You should \nbe able to use your unlimited data without worrying about thes e false alerts. Customer: \nHow many other unlimited plan customers are getting incorrect limit warnings and \nunnecessarily restricting their usage? Agent: That's a concerning question. If the alert \nsystem isn't updating automatically with plan changes, it co uld be affecting other \nunlimited customers too. Customer: This is a significant system flaw that's defeating the \npurpose of unlimited plans. Agent: I'll disable the data limit alerts on your account \nimmediately and escalate this as a plan change integratio n issue. Customer: You need \nto audit all unlimited plan customers to make sure they're not getting false limit alerts.",

      "transcript": "Agent: Total Wireless support, this is Benj amin. \nCustomer: I'm trying to use SMS commands to manage my account, but half of them \ndon't work and the help menu is confusing. Agent: I'd be happy to help you with SMS \ncommands. Which specific commands are you having trouble with? Customer: I texted \nHELP  and got a list of commands, but when I try to use them, most respond with 'invalid \ncommand' errors. Agent: Let me check which SMS commands are currently functional... \nI see that several commands listed in our HELP response are actually disabled or \ndepreca ted. Customer: So you're advertising SMS commands that don't actually work? \nThat's misleading. Agent: You're right that the HELP menu should only show commands \nthat are currently functional and properly working. Customer: I tried DATA to check my \nusage, AD D to purchase add -ons, and PLAN to view my plan details. None of them \nworked. Agent: Those are all listed in our HELP menu, but I can see they're not working \nproperly. The SMS command system seems to have multiple broken features. \nCustomer: Why offer SMS c ommands at all if they're not going to work reliably? Agent: \nSMS commands should provide a quick way for customers to access basic account \ninformation, but clearly our implementation has significant issues. Customer: I wasted \ntime trying to use these comma nds when I could have just called or used the app. \nAgent: I understand the frustration. Non -working features waste customer time and \ncreate a poor experience. Customer: You should either fix all the SMS commands or \nremove them from the HELP menu so custome rs don't expect them to work. Agent: \nYou're absolutely right. I'll escalate this as a priority issue to either fix the SMS \ncommand system or update the help documentation.",
